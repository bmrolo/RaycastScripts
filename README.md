- A showcase of my Rasycast scripts

- I intend to showcase these scripts as I want to share the value I gain from the scripts, and spread the power of Raycast!

## How to create a Raycast Script:
1. Open Raycast
2. Type "cmd"
3. Click on "Create Script Command"
### You will get a page that looks like this:

### From there, fill out the information as needed.
